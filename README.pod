=head1 NAME

Array::Queue - A simple fifo queue

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $queue = Array::Queue->new;
    $ar->add({ id => 20 });
    $ar->add({ id => 18 });
    $ar->add({ id => 22 });

    while ($node = $queue->first) {
        # do things with node
        $queue->remove;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Array::Queue is a fairly simple First-In / First-Out queue build with Moose.

Any data structure can be added to the queue and retrieved in the order it was 
added.  

Originally part of Array::Queue::Priority until I decided to break them into two
classes, the one dependant on the other.
